## Metaprogramming in C&#35;

My background is in ruby, and I'm just playing around with C#'s DynamicObject, and seeing what all I can do. :-)

For reference, all the objects I'll be playing with can be found here in [System.Dynamic](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.dynamic(v=vs.110).aspx)
